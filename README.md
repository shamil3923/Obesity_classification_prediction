# Obesity_classification_prediction
Predicting the obesity category using ML model(Desion Tree, XGBOOST, LightGBM)
PROJECT GOAL: OUR PROJECT AIMED TO DEVELOP AMACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM FOR ACCURATELY CLASSIFYING INDIVIDUALS INTO DIFFERENT OBESITYLEVELS.
MODEL PERFORMANCE: WE ACHIEVED PROMISINGRESULTS...
XGBOOST ACCURACY: 0.9063 
LIGHTGBM ACCURACY: 0.9099 
DECISION TREE ACCURACY: 0.8460 
ENSEMBLE ACCURACY: 0.9096  Combines strengths of individual models (XGBoost,LightGBM)
